## Brainstorm

Here's what's in my mind at the moment. It's rudimentary, but it's a starting point for discussion.

### Repositories (pending a final name for the app)

- [`assemble-design`](https://github.com/assemblehere/assemble-design) (aka this repo) contains design work, high-level plans, and so on
- [`assemble-mobile`](https://github.com/assemblehere/assemble-mobile) is a React Native project that provides apps for iOS and Android
- `assemble-web` for a website and, if needed, a web version of the app

### Infrastructure

I have no idea yet ;-)
