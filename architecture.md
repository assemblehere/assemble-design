## Brainstorm

Here's what's in my mind at the moment. It's rudimentary, but it's a starting point for discussion.

### Repositories (pending a final name for the app)

- [`mobilization-app-design`](https://github.com/cz/mobilization-app-design) (aka this repo) contains design work, high-level plans, and so on
- `mobilization-app-server` would be a repo that powers the database and a GraphQL server
- [`mobilization-app-mobile`](https://github.com/cz/cadre-app) is a React Native project that provides apps for iOS and Android
- `mobilization-app-web` for a website and, if needed, a web version of the app

### Infrastructure

I have no idea yet ;-)
